# Sample-JS-Testing
Trying to build a lab to start a curriculum 

# Purpose

<p>This is meant to be a self built lesson helping me to learn the absolute basics of testing w/ Jest. In this lesson, I have written tests for basic math functions add() and sub(). I then included a total() function, designed to take in and use the add() function in the solution.</p>

<p>I then moved to writing non-math tests. First stringTheory, which tests that a function returns a specific string. Next was myBeverage, which is an object with multiple properties expressed as booleans. </p>

<p>Feel free to clone this lab and try to solve these problems. Any feedback via issues here on GitHub would be appreciated. </p>
